## Git what it is and why should I care
Starting with this popular and hackneyed title I would like to present what have I learned about Git on my classes

### 1. Git
![what is git](what-is-git.jpg)
It is version control system which helps to keep track on changes, enables user to go back to previous versions and it works really well in larger groups that are working on the same code so they can make branches on which they can work on simultanously without messing with master branch. 
### 2. It is recommended to use command line
![git command line](git-command-line.jpg)
Although GUI is very compelling to use, it is simpler and faster to use command line while using git. At first it can be frustrating and can lead to many weird merged files but later it proves to be more convienient to use terminal. 

### 3. Commands
![git-commit](git-add.jpg) 
+ git add - is a basic command that adds copy of file from computer to repository
+ git commit - for me it's the most problematic command because it expects commit message to be written and usually I don't want everyone to know that I've messed up the file and I need to replace it manually or use another questionable git practices. 
+ git push - it is usually the last command before our file will be send to repository.
+ git status - it's a command that shows uncommited changes and if there are some conflicts
+ git pull - is used to download changes from repository to local machine

TASK 4. Add more information to the README in Markdown, including headers, subheaders, bullet pointsâ€¦

Explain in this file the most important things and commands you learned about Git. In other words, write a summary about Git that could serve you in the future to remember how to use it
